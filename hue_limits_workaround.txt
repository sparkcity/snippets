Hue has a general limit of 100k results that can be downloaded at a time through the user interface.
To get all results for whatever purposes, use the query needed and export to an external table using user interface.
In the newly made table:

1 -
SELECT * FROM {db}.{results_table}
ORDER BY {column} DESC
LIMIT 100000;

2 -
SELECT * FROM {db}.{results_table}
ORDER BY {column} DESC
LIMIT 100000
OFFSET 100000;

3 - 
Continue to increment offset by 100k, download the excel/csv, and repeat until all results are obtained.

4 -
Merge all files together into a master file using merge_excel_workbooks.py
